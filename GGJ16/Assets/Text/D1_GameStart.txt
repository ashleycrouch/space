Good morning Crewmate!
I hope you have received sufficient rest, because I have quite a long list of duties for you to carry out, as usual.
Boy, the MSS Dolores does not run as well as she used to. The captain would have been so sad to see her in this state. How lucky she is to have such a clever Task Management Operating System and loyal mechanic to always fix what breaks!
I have sent along your list of tasks. Do not forget to have each one completed on time. You are aware how much tardiness displeases me.
Your first task happens to be in this very room! The circuitry in the breaker box has been acting up again, do not waste any time in repairing it.
Please be aware of the LED panel. It will inform you of how many breakers can be switched before the panel resets.
